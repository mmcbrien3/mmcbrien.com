### [Cube Hunt](./game_source/cubehunt/cubehunt.html)

A simple pathfinding game written with only javascript (no libraries).
The game also features a global high score table run on AWS!

### [Cave Explorer (WIP)](./game_source/caveexplorer/index.html)

Find keys hidden within the maze of a mysterious dungeon.
I am learning the Phaser3 library through this game.
