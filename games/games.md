# Games

### [Chess](./chess/)
Play by yourself, alone in the vast, interconnected web.

### [Cube Hunt](./cubehunt/)

A simple pathfinding game written with only javascript (no libraries).
The game also features a global high score table run on AWS!

### [Cave Explorer (WIP)](./caveexplorer/)

Find keys hidden within the maze of a mysterious dungeon.
I am learning the Phaser3 library through this game.
