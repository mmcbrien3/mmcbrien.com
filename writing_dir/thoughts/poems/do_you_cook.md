#### Do you cook?

Do you cook?\
Have you taught yourself this skill?\
Tomatoes and garlic and carrots,\
Wine and oregano and rosemary:\
What do these words mean to you?

Have you fought a friend and lost him?\
Stand aside and watch two wills:\
Do you see that one is your own?\
Does something stand above your own comfort;\
Something that stands on your shoulders?

Have you read Confessions?\
Has Augustine ever crossed your mind?\
Has the holy word from a world away\
Lingered at the door, hoping to stay?\
Asking for a past life, what will I find?

Do you abhor ancestors and embrace them?\
Does the crossing of the Alps\
Cause you to cross the street?\
Scipio Africanus could be your father,\
but I know he could not be you.

Do you ponder your heart's trepidations?\
Does the wind of the world find\
Harmony at rest in your depth?\
Have you felt a flutter within\
And wondered, "What is sin?"

Have you fought a friend and lost him?\
Have you read Confessions?\
Do you abhor ancestors and embrace them?\
Do you ponder your heart's trepidations?\
No? Then you must not cook.
