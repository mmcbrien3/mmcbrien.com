#### Silver, Steel, and Sacrament

Silver, Steel, and Sacrament:\
earth's conquering charms.

Crassus held the keys to the Roman vault.\
Isabella sent Columbus to the New World.\
But Caesar crossed the Rubicon,\
And the Italian planted his flag in America.

Napoleon had his Austerlitz.\
Hannibal had his Alps.\\
But the Duke lay in wait,
And Carthago delenda est.

Luther used a hammer;\
Christ lay beneath one.\
But Nietzsche had his words\
And Sartre had the French.

Historians -- all.\
Seek to tell our tale from whence we are able.\
To the last birth to the Fall.\
The past calls! Hark! A cable!\
How now! What stirs the heart?\
They have studied, and now I start,\
For who have played their part.\
They erred with all their art.\
The motivator; the flame;\
On account of this; we overcame;\
Now, there are two.\
Once, there was you.
