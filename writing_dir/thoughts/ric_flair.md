### A Melvillian Review of Durkin's 2023 *The Iron Claw*

#### January 10th, 2023

*The Iron Claw* is a film written and directed by Sean Durkin. Told from the perspective
of Kevin Von Erich, it follows the obsession of his father, Fritz Von Erich, with 
wrestling greatness and his menacing power over his young sons. In the film, we meet
four of these sons: Kerry, the hyper-focused athlete who turns to grappling after political
fortunes scuttle his chances at representing the USA; David, the affable, eloquent
star of the family in the early days; Mike, the melancholic musician who has a different
dream; and of course Kevin, our implicit narrator and who talks of, struggles with,
and lives out his fraternal duties.

The film is nothing if not tragic, sadly echoing the real life story of the Von Erichs.
Three of the brothers, Kerry, David, and Mike, all perish, increasing the family's
heartbreak -- and their belief in the Von Erich curse. David is killed by a sickness
that bursts his insides while he is at the peak of his career. Mike takes his own life
after a wrestling accident and botched procedure leave him handicapped -- unable to
strum a few chords on a guitar that use to be his life blood. And Kerry shoots himself
in the head with a weapon he bought for his father, undone by years of neglect and pain.

Throughout the devastation, the film focuses on Fritz's unceasing obsession with glory
in the ring. He is constantly raging around his family's ranch and in the Sportatorium's
office. They have been wronged; the title belt has been taken from them; the men in
charge cannot keep getting away with this.

The movie does an excellent job of handling the subject of wrestling's integrity. Pam
bluntly asks Kevin about this on their first date, wondering how people can love the sport
so much if it's prearranged. Kevin explains that it's worth working hard because you
are really auditioning for the audience's adoration. It's an explanation that is enough
to satisfy wrestling skeptics, but it's main purpose is to set up a contrast to Fritz's
monomania.

Everyone knows the sport is fake. Pam, far from an expert, knew this before she was ever
with Kevin. Kevin admits that it is a performance and not strictly about athletic prowess.
Regardless, Fritz rages about the invisible hand of arbiters that we never meet. We hear
of their decisions through word of mouth and through phone calls. Never once do we meet
a flesh and blood human who stands in the way of the Von Erichs.

The closest we get to meeting a manifestation of their frustration is in the wrestlers who
hold the world championship belt. We meet two of these characters. First is Harley Race.
Harley's appearance on screen is meant to make you chuckle and to make you weep. Here is
the world champion; here is the man who is at the absolute peak of World Class Championship
Wrestling; here is the lone actor who spits in the face of the dreams of the Von Erichs. And
here is a portly, balding man who looks more fit to be a professional bowler than brawler.
How can anyone respect the integrity of an institution that selects this as their sporting
champion?

Next we meet the world famous Ric Flair. Ric Flair matches up against a Von Erich twice in the
film. Immediately following David's death, the white-haired stallion faces Kerry Von Erich.
Kerry finally achieves his father's life long dream of wearing the belt into their home. Yet there
is so little celebration -- the film only gives you the emotion of crestfallen sadness that
comes the night after grasping a vapid dream; the achievement of which only serves to instruct
that putting your worth into a physical accomplishment is a hollow way to live. Kerry, back on top
in the family rankings, goes on a midnight cruise on his chopper. Eschewing scenes of the
ensuing catastrophe, the film cuts to Kerry walking about the house on crutches with only
a single leg remaining.

In the second encounter with Ric Flair, Kevin enters the ring. Embattled by tragedy and loss since
the start of the film, he faces Flair with an uncharacteristic rage. He goes off script and 
takes the milky-locked man, the man embodying his family's curse and the death of his brothers,
into the grips of the iron claw. So filled with fury, he ignores the referees warning and is
disqualified from the fight. Immediately after this emotional brawl, Flair struts into the locker room
of the downcast Kevin and compliments him on his prowess before asking the best place to get a beer
nearby. His nonchalance casts a light on the depressive mood on the other half of the locker room.
This family has fought and battled for literally decades to achieve the same success as this man
next to them and he only wants to get drunk. But this should serve as no surprise -- Ric Flair is
not a manifestation of a family's suffering; he is just a performer like them. His
wrestling and the accolades he have achieved are an illusion that only have meaning because Fritz
has imbued them with such.

Near the conclusion of the film, Kerry takes his own life at the family ranch. Enraged by the loss
of another brother, Kevin turns to their father and spits his rebuke, blaming him
for the family's pain. He tackles the once-wrestler and takes his neck between his hands.
Fritz is powerless under the iron grip of his son and only survives by Kevin's slackening.

This movie is overtly about masculinity. Men are the heroes and villains of this story -- in no
way taking away from the tragic and true lives of Pam and Doris, but in this movie they mainly
serve as foils for their partners. Men are the heroes and villains not because of what besets them, 
but by how they react to their trials. You can rage against the walls that have been built around 
you or you can learn to be happy in your box. Such is the story of Fritz and Kevin.

But this film also focuses on a specific vice of masculinity gone amok, namely obsession --
monomania. Monomaniacal is befitting a word of the character of Fritz Von Erich and it is
also how Captain Ahab is described in Melville's 1851 American novel *Moby-Dick*. That story
has been renowned for its many faceted plot, serving as an allegory for as many human stories
as it has pages. Some see it as a tale of man's search for meaning. Others read it and find
a political story -- either one rooted in American imperialism of the 1800s or one looking
to the globalism of modern times. Whatever shape the myth takes, it is certainly a story
of obsession.

The parallels between *The Iron Claw* and *Moby-Dick* are quite striking when viewed through
a Melvillian lense. Of course we have our Ahab -- strutting around Texas as Fritz Von Erich.
Ahab would be of little import without his tireless crew, stirred up to hunt the whale alongside
him. Fritz's sons take on the role of the sailors of the Pequod.

Not only does Fritz's obsession mirror Ahab's, but so does his propensity for articulate speeches.
Both characters have noteworthy orations, either to huge audiences or to members of their crew
one on one.

And how will Ahab kill Moby-Dick? With a harpoon of course. A harpoon that he forges on the decks
of his ship, dousing the thing in the blood of his crew, shouting "Ego non baptizo te in nomine
patris, sed in nomine diaboli!" Despite his Latin outburst, it is comic to consider Ahab's impotent
ploy to kill the greatest whale in the seven seas, no matter the weapon.

Fritz Von Erich has his own implement that he will use to hunt his whale: the iron claw. And in this
case it is undeniably farcical to consider that his means of achieving the top of the wrestling
world is by pinching a fellow wrestler's head. In addition to the ineffectiveness of the weapons
of choice of our captains, it is notable that another famous character based on Ahab had a tool
explicitly described as an iron claw. The first introduction of Captain Hook in *Peter Pan* concludes with
the following excerpt:

> In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it 
> said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; 
> and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. 
> But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw.

Opposite Ahab, we have the whale, an embodiment of the pointlessness of the world; of the universe's
apathy to man. And opposite Fritz, we have Ric Flair, a flashy showman who wants to drink booze 
after the show and who is more of an actor than an athlete. (And, perhaps out of sheer
historical luck, Ric Flair has flowing, *white* hair). Just as in the story of the whalers, a limb
is lost following the initial encounter with the object of their obsession. And how does the
second encounter go? Boiling with rage, Kevin fails to defeat Flair, just as Ahab screams
at the earless creature, "for hateâ€™s sake I spit my last breath at thee," before being noosed
by his own rope and dragged to the bottom of the sea. The fate of *The Iron Claw*'s Fritz is
similar -- strangled to near death not by a rope but by the hands of his son.

Ishmael ends his story as an orphan, rescued by the crew of the *Rachel* somewhere in the Pacific
Ocean. Kevin's final scene in *The Iron Claw* has him contemplating his own lost family, remarking
that he "*used* to be a brother." But the film does not conclude with our narrator lost in the sea
of his life, but, instead, he is uplifted by the company of his own sons. Kevin has given up his
life-long pursuit of his father's dream for simple happiness with his wife and family on his own
ranch. Did Ishmael also return to the shores of Nantucket and turn his back on whaling, seeking
a quite life in the countryside of New England? Sean Durkin says he did.
