# Chef's Log
I am not a skilled cook. I want to change that. I am going to try to cook some dishes and write about what went right and what went wrong. The purpose of this is to not enumerate recipes, but it will include a list of recipes. The purpose of this is to become better at cooking by doing it more frequently and reflecting upon the experience.

In each log, I will provide the following: an overview, a rating (both of how much I like the dish when it's good and how well I think I executed), an ingredient's list, and some logs about how it all went and what to differently next time.

## Logs
